## Quote from You ##

  "If you're like me and browse Netflix's and Hulu's list of shows trying to find something to watch longer than actually watching tv, or simply want to find similar songs based on your favorite artist, then simply use Guideify. I'm not much of a bookworm, but if you are, Guideify needs to be your all-in-one go to for entertainment recommendations."

## How to Get Started ##

  Simply input an artist, song, author, tv show, or movie to get a list of recommendations.

## Customer Quote ##

  "I simply have to type in my favorite tv show name and can get a list of recommendations! I know if a show is good if there are many likes."

## Closing and Call to Action ##

  Finish your favorite tv shows, movies, books, and get sick of your favorite artist, then turn to Guideify (or use it once available.).
